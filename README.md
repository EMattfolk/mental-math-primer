# Mental Math Primer

I was helping my sister with math practice for HÃ¶gskoleprovet and I wanted to
recommend a good practice tool which she could use to improve her speed.
Unfortunately there are no good and easily accessible apps for training mental
math in App Store or the web, so I thought I would create my own. For the
record it did not turn out great in my opinion, but it was fun creating at
least!

This project was me exploring functional programming for web apps. I would
definitely use Elm for creating websites in the future.
